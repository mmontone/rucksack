* UPDATE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS & friends.

  What should we do when the class has been redefined more than once
  before an instance is loaded?  Example: an instance of class PERSON
  (with schema version 0) was saved.  Now PERSON is redefined twice,
  and the most recent schema for class PERSON has version number 2.
  Ideally, UPDATE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE-... would be called twice.  But
  that doesn't work in practice, because we can only allocate an instance
  corresponding to the most recent class definition.

  Suppose that version 0 of the PERSON class had an AGE slot, version 1
  discards the AGE slot and adds a YEAR-OF-BIRTH slot, and version 2
  discards the YEAR-OF-BIRTH slot and adds a BIRTH-DATE slot.  Suppose
  also that there are PERSON instances corresponding to version 0,
  instances of version 1 and instances of version 2.

  When loading instances of version 2, we don't need to do anything special
  because version 2 is the most recent version.  For instances of version 1,
  UPDATE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE-... will be called with BIRTH-DATE as added
  slot, YEAR-OF-BIRTH as discarded slot and the property list (YEAR-OF-BIRTH
  <year-of-birth>).  For instances of version 0, UPDATE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE-...
  will be called with BIRTH-DATE as added slot, AGE as discarded slot and
  the property list (AGE <age>).

  So UPDATE-PERSISTENT-INSTANCE-... will be called exactly once, and it
  needs to inspect the lists of added/discarded slots if it wants to handle
  multiple version changes.

  Whenever a schema becomes obsolete, we mark it as obsolete and register
  the names of the slots that were added and the slots that were discarded
  (by the most recent version, compared to this version).
