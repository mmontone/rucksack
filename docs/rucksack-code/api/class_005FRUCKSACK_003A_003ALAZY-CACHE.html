  >A lazy cache doesn't bother with fancy mechanisms
for deciding which objects to remove from the cache.  It just fills
the cache until maximum capacity (i.e. CACHE-SIZE) and then clears
the entire cache at once.  Advantages of this could be that it uses
less time and less memory to do its work.  Disadvantage is that it's
very stupid about the objects it should try to keep in memory.</blockquote
