  >Returns the correct position for a transaction-id in a version-list.
To be more precise, it returns:
  1. the block of the object version with the oldest transaction that's
younger than the given transaction-id (nil if there is no such version).
  2. the block of the first object version in the version list that has
a transaction id older than the given transaction-id (nil if there is no
such version).
  VERSION-LIST is either nil or the heap position of the first object
version in the version list.</blockquote
